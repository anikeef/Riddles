# Problems (the old name is Riddles)

This projects is supposed to summarize my knowledge on how to implement basic authentication machinery with Ruby on Rails.

Features:
* Responsive design
* Sign up
* Log in

NOTE: I renamed the app to Problems in the last moment, so it is possible that you can meet the old name "Riddles" somewhere in the source code
