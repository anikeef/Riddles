# Riddles

This projects is supposed to summarize my knowledge on how to implement basic authentication machinery with Ruby on Rails.

Features:
* Responsive design
* Sign up
* Log in

**NOTE: I renamed the app to Problems in the last moment, but you will encounter this new name only in the views. In the remaining part of the app, all posts are still called "riddles"**
